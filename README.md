# Monochromatic Snake

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Unity3D. The game features a monochromatic color scheme and simple controls. The player must navigate the snake to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own tail.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
- Eat the food to grow longer.
- Avoid collisions with the walls or the snake's own tail.
- The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own tail.
